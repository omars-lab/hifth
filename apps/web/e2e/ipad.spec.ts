/*
 * The web app on an iPad-sized WebKit — the same engine the native shell hosts.
 *
 * The shell (native/) adds no layout of its own: it shows this app in a window
 * that is an iPad screen, portrait or landscape, and the app decides what to
 * draw from the width and height it is given. So the question "what does the
 * iPad app look like?" is answered here, headless and in seconds, and the
 * shell's own XCUITest smoke only has to prove that the window opens at the
 * right route (native/HifthUITests/SmokeTests.swift).
 *
 * Two facts these tests pin, both of which the shell depends on:
 *
 *   • Portrait is one page and landscape is the open mus'haf. The desktop
 *     breakpoint is 1024×775 (docs/design/desktop.md); an iPad Pro 11 is
 *     834×1194 upright and 1194×834 on its side, so one and the same route
 *     draws one leaf or two depending only on how the iPad is held.
 *   • Turning the iPad keeps the reader's place. The shell does nothing on
 *     rotation; the page's own resize handling has to carry the route across.
