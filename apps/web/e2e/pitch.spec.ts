/*
 * The pitch build's held commentary — the one screen no public test can touch.
 *
 * `make e2e` builds the PUBLIC bundle, and the public bundle drops the pitch
 * layer entirely (the private code is dead-code-eliminated), so nothing in the
 * ordinary suite ever mounts the commentary sheet. This spec is the exception,
 * and it can only run where two things the public build lacks are both present:
 * the pitch bundle (VITE_PITCH=1) and the private note file, which is gitignored
 * and lives on one laptop. So it runs only under the `pitch` project, which
 * `make pitch-e2e` builds and serves; a bare `playwright test` skips it, the
 * same way `make golden` is honest about running only where its baseline is.
 *
 * What it guards, all three the "no drawer on tap" report turned up:
 *   1. Tapping a verse that HAS a Study Quran note opens the note on that tap —
 *      not on a second click of a footer button (the two-click bug).
 *   2. The note lands on the FACING leaf, opposite the verse (Option D,
 *      docs/design/ayah-drawer.md), so it never covers the verse it is about.
 *   3. A verse with NO note opens nothing — only al-Fātiḥah was extracted, so
 *      every al-Baqarah verse is a live check that selection alone is silent.
